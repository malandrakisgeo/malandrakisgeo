ðŸ‘‹ Hey everyone! My name is George Malandrakis and I am a software developer. I was born and raised in Greece and I am currently settled in Sweden. 

  I have a BSc in Computer Engineering and I study part-time for a second one in Mathematics. I have been interested in computer 
programming since my teen years, and work as a fulltime developer since 2018. I work as a fullstack dev, focusing in Java.

  Unlike other devs, I prefer to spend my spare time on activities such as socializing, reading history, discussing politics, writing, solving maths, and hit the gym when time allows it. Yet I've lately developed a strong interest in system/kernel programming as well, and I spend some hours every weekend becoming better at it.

  I am not really interested in getting a new job, yet offers are always welcome, especially for work in Sweden or Norway. You can contact me via gmail (malandrakisgeo). You may use Greek, English, German, or Swedish.
